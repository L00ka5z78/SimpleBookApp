Simple book shop, connected to mysql database with simple backend.
You can add books, delete and update them.
When you dd a book, you have to fill out the form with title, description, price and cover picture.
It is stored in database.

Tech stack used:
JS, React, mysql, react router dom, express.js

On the positive style:
-works fine,
-i think code is pretty clear and easy to read nd understand.
-not large ammounts of code in one file.

On the negative side:
-styling. Its not my strongest side, but it doesnt matter in this case so much. Main goal was to practise some react routines and frontend - backend connection.
- update function doesnt work properly. Sometimes updates things well, sometimes dont. No error, code seems to be fine. No clue why, actually.
